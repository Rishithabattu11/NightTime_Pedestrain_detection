## üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èNighttime Pedestrian Detection Based on a Fusion of Visual Information and Millimeter-Wave Radar
---

## üìå Overview
This project implements a **nighttime pedestrian detection system** that fuses **infrared vision information** with **millimeter-wave (MMW) radar data** to improve detection accuracy in low-visibility conditions.  
The system leverages an improved **YOLOv5 deep learning model** along with **Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF)** for robust localization and multimodal decision-level fusion.

## üöÄ Project Workflow & Output 

The system follows these main stages:
<br>


**1.Dataset Loading**
<br>
Pedestrian dataset (infrared images) is uploaded.
<br>
Example: 2,199 images detected in the dataset.
<br>
Dataset is then pre-processed and split into training (80%) and testing (20%).

<br>



**2.Dataset Preprocessing**
<br>
Images are shuffled, resized, and normalized.
<br>
Splitting for training and testing is performed.
<br>
Example split: 1759 training images and 440 testing images.

<br>


**6.Prediction on Test Data**
<br>
The trained models are used to detect pedestrians in infrared test images.
<br>
Bounding boxes are drawn around pedestrians with detection probability.
